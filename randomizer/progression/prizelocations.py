# ie TOAD_IN_MUSHROOM_WAY_1 = Flag(0x7052, 4) = $7052 bit 4

# There are no longer any missable checks. All missable checks have become permanent in one way or another

# note: hidon + pandorite mimics work weird. they do three things
# they can appear in any chest
# say for example the fight is in the MushroomKingdomMainHall chest...
# 1: the mimic fight begins - this is the MushroomKingdomMainHall check. the mimic fight is not an AP item but it is considered an "item" for internal shuffling purposes
# 2: upon defeat, the mimic drops an item - this is the Mimic1DropRewardLocation check. this is considered checked when MIMIC_1_CLEARED is set (or MIMIC_2_CLEARED). this can in theory be an AP item
# at this point, the chest looks and acts empty from the player's POV, but it is NOT disabled!
# when the player reloads the room, the chest is hittable again for an extra check. this is the Mimic1ReloadRewardLocation and can also in theory be an AP item. this DOES disable the chest
# in memory, this third check is considered done when the host chest (MushroomKingdomMainHall for ex.) has its object trigger disabled
# so it's kind of like a chest checked condition gets deferred when a mimic is found
# the actual chest that does this is random every seed
# i am not sure what that implies for AP but we can work it out

# not sure what to do about InfiniteCoinsPrize
# normally an easy way to tell a chest is checked is if its object trigger is disabled
# but the chest that holds infinite coins never disables its object trigger
# can be in a random chest
# is it possible for tracker to know ahead of time which chest it is in and flag it as checked when first opened?
# when the player first hits the chest that contains infinite coins it will set the INFINITE_COINS_FOUND bit regardless of what chest it's been shuffled into
